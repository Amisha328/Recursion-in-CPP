### Applications of recursion in computer science:

1) Many algorithms are based on recursion
<br/>
   -> Dynamic Programming
   -> Backtracking
   -> Divide and Conquer

2) Many problem inherently recursive
<br/>
    -> Tower of Hanoi
    -> Depth First Search (DFS) based Traversal

and many more...
